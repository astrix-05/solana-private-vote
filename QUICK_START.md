# Quick Start Guide - Private Vote on Localhost

## Current Status
✅ Smart Contract - Complete and working  
✅ Frontend - Complete with demo mode  
⚠️ Blocking Issue - React dependencies need to be installed

## To Run on Localhost:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (Required)
```bash
cd app
npm install
```

This will install all React dependencies. It may take a few minutes.

### Step 2: Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Use the Application

The app is currently in **DEMO MODE** which means:
- ✅ You can see all UI components
- ✅ You can interact with all features
- ✅ All functionality is simulated
- ⚠️ No actual blockchain transactions
- ⚠️ No wallet connection required

### Features Available in Demo Mode:

1. **Create Poll** - Create polls with questions and options
2. **Vote** - Cast votes on active polls
3. **Manage Polls** - View and manage your polls
4. **View Results** - See poll results with charts

### Current Limitations:

- No wallet connection (working on it)
- No real Solana transactions (simulated)
- No Arcium encryption (simulated)
- Mock data only

### To Enable Full Functionality:

1. Deploy the smart contract:
   ```bash
   anchor deploy
   ```

2. Install wallet provider (Phantom/ Solflare)

3. Connect to a Solana network (localnet/devnet)

4. The app will automatically detect and use real blockchain

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module" errors
Run `npm install` again in the app directory

### Port 3000 already in use
The app will automatically use the next available port

### Styling issues
Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly configured (already done)

## Next Steps for Full Deployment:

1. ✅ Smart Contract - Ready
2. ⏳ Install Frontend Dependencies
3. ⏳ Configure Environment Variables
4. ⏳ Deploy to Localhost
5. ⏳ Add Real Wallet Integration
6. ⏳ Add Real Arcium SDK

For now, the app runs in demo mode showing all UI and functionality!
