# 🚀 How to Run Private Vote System

## ✅ **Correct Command to Start the App:**

### Run from app directory:
```bash
cd app
npm start
```

### NOT:
```bash
npm run dev  ❌ This doesn't exist
npm start    ❌ Wrong directory
```

## 📋 **Available Scripts:**

In `app/package.json`, you have:
- ✅ `npm start` - Start development server
- ✅ `npm build` - Build for production
- ✅ `npm test` - Run tests

## 🎯 **Quick Start:**

### Terminal Commands:

```bash
# Navigate to app directory
cd app

# Start the app
npm start
```

## 🔍 **Why It's Not Working:**

### Issue 1: Running from wrong directory
```bash
❌ From /solana-private-vote: npm start
✅ From /solana-private-vote/app: npm start
```

### Issue 2: Wrong script name
```bash
❌ npm run dev (doesn't exist)
✅ npm start (correct script)
```

## 📂 **Directory Structure:**

```
solana-private-vote/
├── app/              ← Go here first!
│   ├── package.json  ← Has "start" script
│   ├── src/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## 🎊 **Current Status:**

Your app should already be running at:
**http://localhost:3000**

### To Start (if not running):

```bash
cd /Users/astrix_05/solana-private-vote/app
npm start
```

## ✅ **Correct Workflow:**

1. Open terminal
2. Run: `cd /Users/astrix_05/solana-private-vote/app`
3. Run: `npm start`
4. Wait for compilation
5. Browser opens at http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 **Summary:**

**Use**: `npm start` (from app directory)  
**Not**: `npm run dev`  
**From**: `/Users/astrix_05/solana-private-vote/app`

**Your app is currently running at http://localhost:3000** ✅
