  isActive: true,
  votes: 0,
  creator: publicKey,
  voters: [],
  expiryDate: pollData.expiryDate,
  isAnonymous: pollData.isAnonymous || false
};
```

### Anonymous Status Indicators

{poll.isAnonymous && (
  <span style={{
    padding: '2px 8px',
    background: '#e3f2fd',
    color: '#1976d2',
