# Error Fix Summary

## Issue Found:
The error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './App'" was appearing because:
1. The dev server was trying to compile while files were being modified
2. Webpack cache needed to be cleared

## Actions Taken:
1. âœ… Cleared webpack cache (`rm -rf node_modules/.cache`)
2. âœ… Killed existing process on port 3000
3. âœ… Restarted development server with `npm start`
4. âœ… Files are verified correct (App.tsx exists and has default export)

## Current Status:
- Development server is running in the background
- Compilation should now complete successfully
- App should be available at http://localhost:3000

## What to Do Now:
1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
3. Wait for compilation to finish (may take 30-60 seconds)
4. You should see the Private Vote application

## If Still See Errors:
Run these commands in sequence:

```bash
cd app
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
npm start
```

## Files Verified:
- âœ… src/App.tsx exists
- âœ… src/index.tsx imports App correctly
- âœ… All components exist
- âœ… Dependencies installed

The app should now be working! ðŸŽ‰
